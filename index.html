                <p>
                    Athletes have definitely improved over the years. They are fitter, and have access to high nutrition diet.
                    Tactics have also improved over the years. <br /><br />

                    But, technology has also played in key role in this improvement. <br /><br />

                    Let's start with golf, followed by swimming, and running. <br /><br />

                <h2>Graphite Shafts, 1995</h2>
                <p>
                The graphite shaft was first marketed in 1970 at the PGA Merchandise Show but did not gain widespread use until the mid-1990s and is now used on
                almost all woods and some iron sets, as the carbon-fiber composite of graphite shafts boasts increased flex for greater clubhead speed at the cost
                of slightly reduced accuracy due to greater torque. <br /><br />

                Bottom line, it increased the distance, everything else being the same, by about 7 or 8 yards.

                <h2>Titleist Pro V1, 2000</h2>
                <p>
                In 2000, golf equipment manufacturer Titleist released their solid core ball, the Titleist Pro V1. Because of the solid core, the ball was accurate
                and could be hit for long distances. Many professionals switched from wound core to solid core soon, resulting in a 6 yard increase in drive distance
                between 2000 and 2001. Subsequent generations of the Pro V1 would also greately affect the drive distance.

                <h2>Hybrid Clubs, 2002</h2>
                <p>
                TaylorMade made the hybrid club popular with the release of its first set of hybrids in 2002. A hybrid golf club is simply a golf club which is designed
                to be an easier to hit alternative to a long iron. The primary advantage of a hybrid club is that it has design characteristics that make it easier to hit
                the ball higher. In addition, a hybrid club on average will send a ball approximately 5 to 8 yards further than will a typical iron.

                <h2>Speedo LZR Suits, 2008</h2>
                <p>
                The LZR Elite is a performance body suit first manufactured by Speedo in 2008. The suits are made using a combination of elastane-nylon and polyurethane 
                which reduce skin drag, compress the body and trap air for buoyancy. All these additional features allows for water to repel and reduce drag when swimming.

                <p>
                Before the Speedo LZR Suits were banned, 98% of medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics were awarded to swimmers wearing the suit, and 23 out of the 25 world records broken 
                were swimmers wearing the suit. Before the suits were banned on January 1, 2010 by FINA, the federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee 
                for administering competition of water sport, 93 world records were broken using the suits.
